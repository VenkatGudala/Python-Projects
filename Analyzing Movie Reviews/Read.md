## <font color=blue>Analyzing Movie Reviews</font>
### <font color=green> We are going to analyze movie reviews from four different sites. IMDB, Fandango, Rotten Tomatoes & Metacritic are those sites. Interesting point is that Fandango not just reviews the films, but also sells the tickets online. We would see wether it's reviews are biased or not.</font>

###### Each row represents a single movie. Each column contains information about how the online moview review services RottenTomatoes, Metacritic, IMDB, and Fandango rated the movie. The dataset was put together to help detect bias in the movie review sites. Each of these sites has 2 types of score -- User scores, which aggregate user reviews, and Critic score, which aggregate professional critical reviews of the movie. Each service puts their ratings on a different scale:
 - RottenTomatoes - 0-100, in increments of 1.
 - Metacritic - 0-100, in increments of 1.
 - IMDB - 0-10, in increments of .1.
 - Fandango - 0-5, in increments of .5.
